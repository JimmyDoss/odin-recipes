        <h2>Mexican Lasagna</h2>
            <p>My whole family loves this beefy lasagna flavored  
                with taco seasoning. Even my picky five-year-old <br> 
                will eat it. Serve with shredded lettuce, fresh 
                sliced tomatoes, olives and sour cream.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>    

            <ul>
                <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes with juice</li>
                <li>10 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
                <li>1 cup prepared salsa</li>
                <li>Â½ cup shredded Colby cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <br> 
                <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef,<br>
                    and stir in the taco seasoning and tomatoes. Line a 9x13-inch baking <br> 
                    dish with half the tortillas. Spoon the beef mixture into the dish, then <br>
                    top with the remaining tortillas. Spread salsa over the tortillas and sprinkle <br> 
                    with the cheese.</li>
                    <br> 
                <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is<br> 
                    melted and bubbly.</li>
            </ol>
